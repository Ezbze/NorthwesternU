Filed under:Los Angeles may have lost out on the Olympics (to Boston!), but this is a city of opportunity. Today comes its next chance to welcome all the world: a World's Fair. An Indiegogo campaign was launched just last week by the appropriately-titled Los Angeles World's Fair, seeking $100,000 to build the first of several transit-accessible pavilions all across the city; so far they've raised a pretty impressive $41,000. If things go according to plan, the fair would run for two full years, from 2022 to 2024. The future fair would feature Hyperloops, self-driving vehicles and "3D printed gourmet delicacies." >>Sidewalk Labs has abandoned its proposal to remake Toronto’s waterfront.It’s hard to make sense of recent housing market data.The goal of the unusual siding is to create a facade that will age and "develop a patina that reflects time through material changes."The Gomos System builds adaptable spaces from concrete modules.The family home is split in two—both aesthetically and thematically.These four things can help if you’re at risk of missing a payment because of COVID-19.
