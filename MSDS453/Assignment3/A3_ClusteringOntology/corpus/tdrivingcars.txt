Filed under:Elon Musk says that self-driving Teslas are on the way. In an interview with the Financial Times, Musk declared that his electric car company, Tesla, is officially in the race to bring autonomous vehicles onto the streets — a race that Audi, Mercedes, Nissan, Volvo, General Motors, and Google are already in. The CEO tells the FT that he believes autonomous Teslas will be able to operate largely, but not completely, on their own. "We should be able to do 90 percent of miles driven within three years," Musk says. However, a vehicle that can operate without a human in the cockpit isn't something he thinks is feasible."My opinion is it's a bridge too far to go to fully autonomous cars," Musk explains. "It's incredibly hard to get the last few percent." The executive says that he envisions self-driving Musk wants Teslas with auto-pilot technology operating much like an auto-pilot system that drivers could turn on in most situations. Musk also says that Tesla is working on its self-driving systems in house, and not with an outside partner such as Google — a partnership is a possibility he's brought up in the past. Musk's comments come after the automaker posted a job listing for
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems Controls Engineers to help the company build self-driving technologies for new models, and the current Model S sedan.A newsletter about computers
