Filed under:Data collected from the roads will help the city address traffic congestion & maintenance, and eventually help self-driving carsKansas City, Missouri, is already a leader in the smart city race—remember its public data dashboard that helps drivers find parking spots? But a new startup, Integrated Roadways, will soon add another feather to KC’s tech-city cap. The company is piloting a project to embed sensors in city roads along with phone lines and fiber optic internet cable.The sensors will collect data about road use, speeds, and vehicle weight—giving the city information that can be used to better deploy maintenance efforts and shape transportation policy. The road-embedded tech also has potential for future applications, assisting with the navigation, communication, and power of self-driving cars. Additionally, the new roads include channels for telecom and connectivity companies to run 5G networks or high-speed internet.That’s an important piece of the puzzle, since Integrated Roadways’ business plan hinges on the idea that car companies and communication companies will find the street’s high-tech amenities so valuable that they’ll pay for them—freeing up the city’s transportation budget for road maintenance.“Right now we estimate it, we can send people out to track it, and we can send people out if there’s a problem … but (it would be different) to now be able to give you a precise number and a trend analysis to figure out how we can get traffic off that road, ways to incentivize mass transit, ways to engage the public to mitigate that mass transit issue,” said Kansas City’s chief innovation officer, Bob Bennett.Via: Construction Dive, Government TechnologyA daily dose of design and real estate news, intel, and eye candySidewalk Labs has abandoned its proposal to remake Toronto’s waterfront.It’s hard to make sense of recent housing market data.The goal of the unusual siding is to create a facade that will age and "develop a patina that reflects time through material changes."The Gomos System builds adaptable spaces from concrete modules.The family home is split in two—both aesthetically and thematically.These four things can help if you’re at risk of missing a payment because of COVID-19.
