Filed under:It’s called “ART”China keeps us on our toes when it comes to infrastructure development and new transportation ideas. (We still haven’t forgotten the car-swallowing bus meant to help commuters surpass snarled traffic on China’s highways.)You can add this to the list: This recently unveiled self-driving train—called ART for ‘autonomous rapid rail transit’—doesn’t run on a traditional track. Instead, it rolls along on rubber tires, using sensors to plan and monitor its route along a path painted with road dividing lines.ART—developed by a rail company in the central Chinese city of Zhuzhou, CRRC—can reach speeds of up to 70 kilometers an hour (or about 43 miles per hour) and accommodates up to 500 riders. To boot, ART can travel 40 kilometers (roughly 24.8 miles) on a single electric charge.The train is expected to roll out in Zhuzhou in 2018.Via: DesignboomA daily dose of design and real estate news, intel, and eye candySidewalk Labs has abandoned its proposal to remake Toronto’s waterfront.It’s hard to make sense of recent housing market data.The goal of the unusual siding is to create a facade that will age and "develop a patina that reflects time through material changes."The Gomos System builds adaptable spaces from concrete modules.The family home is split in two—both aesthetically and thematically.These four things can help if you’re at risk of missing a payment because of COVID-19.
