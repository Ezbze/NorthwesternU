Filed under:Request Lyft rides right within the Amtrak app Big news in the transportation world: Intercity rail service Amtrak has announced it’s teaming up with ride-hailing service Lyft to help customers easily get to and from Amtrak stations. Under the new partnership, passengers can directly use the Amtrak mobile app to request Lyft rides (new Lyft users can also get $5 off each of their first four Lyft rides with the promo code AMTRAKLYFT). According to the press release, Lyft’s current coverage nationwide reaches 97 percent of Amtrak riders. Bringing Lyft right within its mobile map allows Amtrak to provide more convenient and seamless trips for passengers. This announcement is just the latest in a string of high-profile moves by Lyft, which seems to be creating notable momentum for itself while its biggest—and much beleaguered—competitor, Uber, continues to face challenges ranging from a leadership void to lawsuits.
Just last week, Lyft announced a buzz-generating, if misguided, promotional partnership with Taco Bell. In May, the company also joined forces with Waymo, Google’s self-driving car company, to bring autonomous cars to U.S. streets.
