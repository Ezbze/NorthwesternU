Filed under:No, it’s not April FoolsGoodyear has just unveiled what is undoubtedly the world’s weirdest, most eco-friendly tire design. Named the Oxygene, the concept tire is made, cannibalistically, out of other recycled tires, 3D-printed into a cool shape and embedded with living, oxygen-producing moss. Oh, and there are glowy lights!The tire’s “non-pneumatic construction” means that nothing is inflated, effectively eliminating the possibility of getting a flat. Which begs the question—is it still a tire if there’s no inflation? Isn’t it then just a wheel?The open lattice of the “tire” where it meets the roadbed allows it to pick up water from the road, “improving wet grip” and conveniently watering the moss within. Moss, like any green plant, absorbs CO2 from the air and releases oxygen through photosynthesis. But that’s not all! Oxygene tires have high-capacity mobile connectivity “at the speed of light” so they can easily communicate with other connected, self-driving cars and smart infrastructure systems.What do you think, Curbed readers? Is this a concept you want to see become reality?
