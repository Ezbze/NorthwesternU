Filed under:Los Angeles may have lost out on the Olympics (to Boston!), but this is a city of opportunity. Today comes its next chance to welcome all the world: a World's Fair. An Indiegogo campaign was launched just last week by the appropriately-titled Los Angeles World's Fair, seeking $100,000 to build the first of several transit-accessible pavilions all across the city; so far they've raised a pretty impressive $41,000. If things go according to plan, the fair would run for two full years, from 2022 to 2024. The future fair would feature Hyperloops, self-driving vehicles and "3D printed gourmet delicacies." >>COVID-19 has caused volatility in seemingly everything but housing.Designed by California architect Mickey Muennig, the home features a jaw-dropping bridge with panoramic ocean views.Embarking on a home renovation project is no easy feat, but there is probably a stellar app out there to assist with every part of the process.The Kennedy family used to summer at Wildmoor, a shingled East Hamptons house a few blocks from the ocean.This Guy Peterson-designed house in Florida blends polished concrete with wood accents.No matter the size of your outdoor space, a great patio chair can transform any yard, balcony, or terrace.
