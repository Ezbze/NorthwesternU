Filed under:The benefits of building a Mario Kart for tomorrow's robot driversWith the era of the self-driving car just over the horizon, companies are already working to develop the tech infrastructure we’ll need to optimize the routes of autonomous vehicles. And one company, Immense Simulations, has turned to video game technology for a powerful solution.The U.K.-based startup has teamed up with Improbable—a video game simulation company formed to make online multi-player worlds—to create virtual replicas of real-world cities and their traffic patterns. Traffic data from these cities is fed into the simulation, enabling car companies to figure out exactly where to send their fleet of self-driving vehicles to accommodate daily traffic patterns or the impact of traffic accidents.It might not sound like much, but creating these virtual cities that update in real time is a big deal for self-driving cars, and can help build out the next-generation infrastructure needed to update our transport network.The U.K.’s Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin has said the project will "profoundly change the way we travel" by "reducing accidents and helping traffic flow more smoothly."Highly Detailed City Simulation is the New Autonomous Taxi Dispatch [MIT Technology Review]Google's Self-Driving Car Learns How to Honk [Curbed]A daily dose of design and real estate news, intel, and eye candyCOVID-19 has caused volatility in seemingly everything but housing.Designed by California architect Mickey Muennig, the home features a jaw-dropping bridge with panoramic ocean views.Embarking on a home renovation project is no easy feat, but there is probably a stellar app out there to assist with every part of the process.The Kennedy family used to summer at Wildmoor, a shingled East Hamptons house a few blocks from the ocean.This Guy Peterson-designed house in Florida blends polished concrete with wood accents.No matter the size of your outdoor space, a great patio chair can transform any yard, balcony, or terrace.
